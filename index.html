                <em>
                <p>Dota is my favourite game (after minecraft and many other games), and I'm a real skill player, so I want to teach you how to play as well!</p>
                <p>I plan to study programming, so I am entering the specialty of Software Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Уральский_федеральный_университет">URFU</a></p>
                <p>This is my first HTML website template, so don't judge strictly</p>
                <p>I don't know English well, so I have to use a translator :(</p>

    <h2>Why Dota QQQ?</h2>
    <p> Let's start with the main thing: why did I call the site Dota QQQ? 
    <p>Everything is incredibly simple. Койл Койл Койл сука! I am Top-1 <a target="_blank" href="https://dota2.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Shadow_Fiend">SF</a> in Novouralsk...  </p>
    <p>Yes, yes I am. It's a pity the girls don't notice my skill... :(</p>
    <p>Maybe if I didn't play computer games and didn't spend my time on them, I could have a girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Well, I don't care about them, I have an arcana for <a target="_blank" href="https://dota2.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Phantom_Assassin">Mortra</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://dota2.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Windranger">Windranger</a></p>
    <br>

    <h2>What is Dota 2?</h2>
    <h3>Okay, let's start talking about Dota 2</h3>
    <p>Defense of the Ancient - this is the abbreviation of the game</p>
    <p>There doesn't seem to be much to do in this game - just defend the main building and fight... </p>
    <p>But Dota is not just about battles. </p>
    <p>An incredibly difficult game in which you need to develop your character by pumping hero levels, mining gold, which can buy more new skills and weapons.</p>
    <p>120 different heroes are waiting for you!</p>
    <p>In this game it is impossible to win "according to the pattern". Each battle is unique.</p>
    <p>Everyone is equal, and the only thing that can lead to victory is your skill.</p>
    <p>Therefore, many are honing their game skills and even trying to make money on it.</p>
    <p>For example, last 2021 Team Spirit - an esports team from Russia - became the world champion in Dota 2 and earned $ 15 million!</p>
    <p>"To make a fortune on some game? Well, they must be very strong!" No!!!</p>
    <p>Dota is not only a skill, but also luck! </p>
    <p>Any, even the slightest moment, the slightest non-completion on the part of your teammate can lead to defeat in battle and further defeat in the game.</p>
    <p>But not everyone wants to become so cool and earn money in Dota.</p>
    <p>Many sweaty workers who came from the factory come to the pillbox to relax.</p>
    <p>And in fact, they don't relax a damn...</p>
    <p>I'm so fucked up by these fucking grandfathers with their harsh voice, who pretend to fumble in the game, but actually suck.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There are also a lot of inadequate players in dota who consider themselves the smartest and strongest players, but in fact they are worthless posers</p>
    <p>Here is a list of the most popular toxic players of Dota 2 >>> <a href="sec.html">The most dangerous people</a></p>
